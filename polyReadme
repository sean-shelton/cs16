#poly0, poly1, poly2

The purpose of the poly projects was to create software that could make polynomials by utilizing
classes and the different methods of implementation. Along with the polynomials, there are many other included
functions, including the ability to add onto the polynomial, evaluate the polynomial, search for its root,
and so forth.

poly0 implements the polynomial code by using a static array, poly1 uses a dynamic array, and poly2 uses
a linked list.
